This is my take on the [Landing Page](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page) project from The Odin Project.

I created a webpage with HTML and CSS according to the following guidelines:
[1. Style Guide](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/a38403e7d81cc8305af16ac48985cfbde87834d6/foundations/html_css/flexbox/project-landing-page/imgs/02.png)
[2. Full Page Layout](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/81a5d553f4073e593d23a6ab00d50eef8620796d/foundations/html_css/project/imgs/01.png)

I intend to improve my code quality by implementing the [BEM](https://getbem.com/naming/) naming convention.
